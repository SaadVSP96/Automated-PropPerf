Combining blade element momentum theory with xfoil to develop an automated propeller performance prediction tool in matlab

This project automates propeller performance prediction using Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) integrated with XFOIL, a panel method solver for subsonic airfoil analysis. XFOIL computes lift and drag coefficients based on airfoil shape, Reynolds number, and Mach number at different sections of the propeller from propeller hub to tip. A MATLAB script automates the BEMT analysis that uses these aerodynamic coefficients, ensuring an accurate physics based method for performance evaluation across varying flight conditions.
